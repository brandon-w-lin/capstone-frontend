One index page that holds the cards, formatting, etc

Pass the data from the view down to the component
- Is it possible to send down the entire card, or do we send the JSON and have the child parse it out? That would then require some conditionals on the child component...
Pass the formatting up from the component to the view

Want to have an audio component that sticks on the app page, but takes a param from whichever page the user is on. For example, if someone picks a song on one page, it plays, and continues to play, even if they are navigating around.
